# Unweighted Influence Data Subsampling

This repository provides a numpy and scipy based implementation on *Unweighted Influence Data Subsampling* (UIDS) on the Logistic Regression model. The UIDS can achieve good result when the data set quality is not good, such as noisy labels, or distribution shift between training and test set, by dropping several bad cases.
